### Data Science

This repository contains a small sample of miscellaneous data science exercises I've done in the past.

Each Jupyter notebook analyses and models various parts of its own dataset. These mostly use pandas and numpy for data analysis, and scikit-learn for modelling.

### Stack Overflow

[My Stack Overflow profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1711796/bernhard-barker?tab=profile) contains a number of posts I've written about algorithms (mostly in Java, C++ or pseudocode), software engineering, statistics and workplace and interpersonal interactions.
